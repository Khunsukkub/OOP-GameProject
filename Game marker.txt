21 ) The oldest minion executes its strategy first

22 ) Interface's value is int but in implement is double

23 ) the interest is current budget * interest rate percentage /100

23.1 ) the interest rate percentage is base interate rate percentage * log10 of current budget * ln current turn

24 ) Grammar for minion strategies have been exists

24.1 ) The arithmetic evaluation is fit in Java's long data type

25 ) Variables whose name start with a lowercase letter are local

26 ) Variables whose name start with a uppercase letter are global

27 ) Special variables can read-only

28 ) ** rounded down to integer **

29 ) change spawnsleft to spawnsRemaining

30 ) random is 0-999

31 ) opponent expression is telling you the closet enemy in 6 directions from the minion

32 ) ally expression is opponent expression but ally

33 ) nearby function is telling your closet enemy power in given direction by 100x+10y+z

33.1 ) x,y,z is the number of digits in the HP/DEF/distance of the discovered minion

33.2 ) If that minion is ally, the power will return by negative

33.3 ) If there is no minion in the given direction, the power will return 0

34 ) done command is end minion strategy

39.3 ) If both player have the sum of minion's HP, Who has more budget will win.

40 ) You can use the Spring Framework to link your Java backend to your web frontend

41 ) The display should have enough information to decide what to do and enjoy the game
